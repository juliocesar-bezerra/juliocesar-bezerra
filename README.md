*Engineering AI solutions that drive operational value within regulated, high-stakes environments.*

</div>

## About Me

I build and deploy AI solutions at the intersection of **financial services**, **regulation**, and **organizational change**. Currently an **AI Specialist at BMW Group Financial Services**, I work on intelligent process automation, ML pipelines, and customer-facing AI products serving over a dozen international markets.

My path is unconventional: I started in **international law** drafting billion-dollar EPC contracts between Brazil and South Korea, then taught myself to code, moved into fintech compliance, and discovered that the most consequential problems live where technology meets regulation. Today I begin with the business problem, work backward to the right architecture, and measure success by operational impact.

### What I Do

- **Intelligent Automation & Multi-Agent Systems** -- Orchestrating governed AI workflows with full decision auditability for complex financial operations
- **ML Modeling & Pipelines** -- Predictive frameworks for recovery optimization, customer retention, and behavioral intelligence
- **GenAI Productionization** -- Advancing prototypes through structured validation stages to production at global scale
- **AI Strategy & Process Transformation** -- Connecting boardroom priorities to engineering execution in regulated environments
