*Leading AI transformation that turns regulatory complexity into competitive advantage — from strategy through global-scale deployment.*

## About Me

I lead AI transformation initiatives that bridge strategic vision with technical execution — turning regulatory complexity into competitive advantage across global financial services operations. Currently **AI Transformation Leader at BMW Group Financial Services**, I drive intelligent automation, ML pipelines, and customer-facing AI products serving 12+ international markets.

My path is unconventional: I started in **international law** drafting billion-dollar EPC contracts between Brazil and South Korea, then taught myself to code, moved into fintech compliance, and discovered that the most consequential problems live where technology meets regulation. Today I begin with the business problem, work backward to the right architecture, and measure success by operational impact.

### What I Do

- **Intelligent Automation & Multi-Agent Systems** — Design and deploy governed AI workflows with full decision auditability, enabling autonomous financial operations at scale
- **ML Modeling & Pipelines** — Build predictive frameworks driving recovery optimization, customer retention, and behavioral intelligence across 12+ markets
- **GenAI Productionization** — Advance GenAI from prototype to production through structured validation, risk mitigation, and stakeholder alignment
- **AI Strategy & Process Transformation** — Translate boardroom priorities into engineering execution, driving measurable ROI in regulated environments
